I'm Leon Seth Copeland, this blurb is a bit about me and what I do here at Verbatim.Studio as a creative.
I started Verbatim.Studio as my own creative place that I could share my work in both a hobbyist and to a certain capacity of professionalism from occasional videography/photography based gigs.

I use Verbatim.Studio as a way to explore my creative median to guide myself to the style that suits me best as a photographer. Using a Fujifilm X-T3 with various lenses I am able to capture the world around me and display it in a digital format here on Verbatim.Studio. I aim to be able to inspire people with the photos I capture and the videos I meticulously design.

### __About Me__

I was born and raised in the beautiful Bay of Plenty in New Zealand at the dawn of this century. From a young age I showed great interest in all forms of Art & Design and realised as a teen that I expressed myself with creativity.

In my spare time I tinker with tech & delve into cyberspace. Currently I am studying for my Diploma in Software Development heading into Cyber Security.
